  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>The focus of this project was to familiarize myself with React. Within React, I experimented with state, componenents, props in order to redesign the 2022 Favorites page for Books on the Square, a local Providence bookstore.
    As an avid reader, I have always found myself feeling at home in bookstores -- however, it can be difficult to replicate that experience online -- even famous bookstores, like the Strand in NYC, have struggled to make the transition to online shops, so I figured I would use this opportunity to try digitizing books.  </p>
<br>
<b>Key Components</b><br>
1) Filters <br>
2) Sorting functionality<br>
3) An aggregator of some kind (cart or favorites etc.) <br>

  <h2>Prototype</h2>
  <p>
    In terms of design, I took inspiration from the Strand and other similar independent booksellers. But this project was mostly focused on functionality.

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>Through this project I learned about the subtlties of React in comparison to HTML/CSS/JS, and the power that it can wield. Going forward I hope to spend more time learning React and creating things that have more interesting functions and better organized code -- but this was a great learning experience. </p>
