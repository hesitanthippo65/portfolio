  <h2 >Context</h2>
  <p>For this project, the goal was to understand more about user interfaces.  <br>
  1) <a href="#observations">Observation:</a> observed several users interacting with a communal microwave, then <br>
  2) <a href="#observations">Interviews:</a> Interviewed them about their experience <br>
  3) <a href="#personas">Personas:</a> Developed "personas" based on observations and their interviews, and <br>
  4) <a href="#story">Storyboard:</a>Storyboarded their interactions.</p>

<div class="container-fluid text-left">
  <h2 id="observations">Observations & Interviews</h2>
  
  <p>Next, I observed users interacting with the interface and interviewed them about their experience.
    I observed three users, each had a different approach. The main observations of each user included <br> <br>
    User 1 inputted times for the microwave while looking at/doing other things in the kitchen; forgot about what was in the microwave and had to re-warm it. <br>
    User 2 stayed to look at the microwave the entire time to monitor the progress of their food.  <br>
    User 3 did more of an iterative process of heating. <br> <br>

    After observing, I interviewed each user and found <br>
    -  All three users showed me how they used the microwave by pointing at the keypad and drawing immediate comparisons between this microwave and their previous microwave (which had express buttons and also a door handle). <br>

    -  Ideal microwave functions: actually heats up food, has clear buttons, has a +30 second quick timer, easy to clean (inside and out). <br>

    -  Contentious microwave debates included: express buttons vs. standard buttons (eg. press 1 for 1 minute, vs. press 1 for the numeral 1), waiting for the timer to beep vs. silencing by stopping before the timer ran out,  sounds on the microwave at all, forgetting about what was in the microwave, and whether specialized buttons are even necessary. <br>

  </p>

<div class="container-fluid text-left">
  <h2 id="personas">Personas</h2>
  <p>Next, I created "personas" based on the observations and interviews. Personas serve as "specific" users or "archetypes", which allow designers to create products catered to a user. Here, I used the observations and responses to interviews to create specific personas that I could then use to understand more about the experience of using the interface and use for storyboarding.

      <img src="images/betty.jpg" width="500px" alt="drawing of betty with actions"> 
    <p><b>Burnt Out Betty</b></p>
    <p>She is the primary cook of her household and as such, puts some unrealistic expectations on herself to cook/present elaborate meals every day — even when she is exhausted. Betty often cooks while thinking about other responsibilities: which leads to her forgetting things in the microwave (necessitating reheating), overheating (due to rushed number punching), and consequent in-microwave explosions that require extensive clean up. “Burnt out Betty” needs a break. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column center">
      <img src="images/arthur.jpg" width="500px" alt="drawing of arthur with actions"> 
    <p><b>Anxious Arthur</b><br>
      When it comes to cooking, or kitchen related tasks in general, Arthur is often more worried about “not taking up too much space” than about the actual cooking.  Arthur is very apologetic, and is often concerned about making too much sound — especially when using the microwave at odds hours to heat up snacks or drinks that have gone room temp. He is known for standing in front of the microwave to make sure it doesn’t beep, and also for religiously clearing the time so that he spares the next user the inconvenience. </p>

  <h2 id ="story">Storyboard</h2>

  <p>The last portion of the project was Storyboarding, using the personas to map out an actual interaction with the interface. </p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>Through this project I learned about methods for engaging in user-centric design: namely user interiews, persona-development, and storyboarding.</p>
